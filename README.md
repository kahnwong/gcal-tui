# gcal-tui

Because I want a quick way to check today's events, or see my week's schedule.

`iCalBuddy` is great, but then I don't use Apple Calendar. Also I use linux half the time.

I found `Calcure` but I want a week-view.

So here we are. Plus I use multiple calendars, so there's that.


## Pre-reqs

Create `Oauth Client ID` with scope `calendar.events`.
